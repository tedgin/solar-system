			<h1>The Solar System from Earth</h1>
			<p>
				This is a first-persion view of the Solar System from Earth displaying the Moon, the
				Sun, and the other seven planets. The Earth is looking directly at the Solar System's
				center of mass. This direction forms the <em><strong>z&#x302;</strong></em> axis. The
				horizontal or <em><strong>x&#x302;</strong></em> axis is aligned so that the span of
				<em><strong>x&#x302;</strong></em> and <em><strong>z&#x302;</strong></em> forms the
				ecliptic plane. The vertical or <em><strong>y&#x302;</strong></em> axis is aligned so
				that the Earth orbits the Sun counterclockwise from the perspective of an observer
				positioned on the positive <em><strong>y&#x302;</strong></em> axis looking towards the
				origin.
			</p>
			<p>
				This simulation isn't real-time. It's not even accurate. It's an <em>N</em>-body
				gravitational simulation. The Sun starts out at the origin at rest. All planets start on
				the negative <em><strong>z&#x302;</strong></em> axis. Each planet starts with its
				distance from the Sun being the same as the semi-major axis of its real orbit. Each
				planet also starts with its speed set to the mean speed of its real orbit, moving
				orthogonal to its position vector so that it moves counterclockwise around the
				<em><strong>y&#x302</strong></em> axis. Each planet's position vector starts out tilted
				towards the <em><strong>y&#x302</strong></em> by an angle equal to its real orbit's
				inclination to the ecliptic plane. The Moon is similarly placed with respect to the
				Earth.
